- Predict optimal pricing using regression models
- Present actionable insights via interactive dashboards

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Raw and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/` – Analysis and modeling notebooks
- `scripts/` – Python scripts for regression and clustering
- `dashboards/` – Tableau dashboard files

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Open `notebooks/pricing_analysis.ipynb` to explore analysis
